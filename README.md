# Decision_Support_System_ML

As part of a first year's master project in a machine learning course, a web app was devepopped with the goal to predict items that are most likely 
to be purchased by clients, a neural network was built for this purpose and called in backend and its code is shared in this repository.

the dataset is shared as it was not a public one but it was mostly features describing users' behaviours (clicks, ratings, items purchased) on a plateform for online shopping.
